<!-- 
    mainly we use 6 display property values
    1. Block
    2. Inline
    3. Inline-Block
    4. Flex
    5. Grid 
    6. None


1. Block 

    <div style="display:block;" class="block-element"> this is red color </div>
    one element on one line
    all height width properties are applied 


2. Inline

   style= "display:inline;" 
   in case of inline height , width will not be applied.Padding , border px will also applied 
   elements are followed adjacent to it 

3. Inline - Block

    <head>
        <style>
            .li{
                display : block;
            } 
        </style>    
    </head>    

    here height,width are applied and also adjacent elements in a single line is possible 

NOTE: text - align : center 

4. Flex 

   1. display : Flex 
   2. it always to be wrapped with child elements where display : flex ; 
      aligns them automatically
   3. Flexbox is dynamic i.e Adjusts layout of its children based on available space on the container.
   4. It is responsive by design for different screen sizes.It can adapt the children automatically
   5. Flex box and inside flex-items
   6. Continues in same line by default and also in horizontal flex items are aligned by default

5.Grid

   1. Introduces 2dimenional arrangement of elements
   2. Complex structured 2d arrangement .Precise control is present here when compared to flex box
   3. space between elements can be managed by grid

When to Use grid


When you need structured layouts with rows and columns (e.g., dashboards, photo galleries,
complex web page designs).
When you need precise control over element alignment and positioning.


When to Use Flex Instead of Grid
Use flex for simpler, one-dimensional layouts like navigation bars or row/column arrangements.




6.None
    1. display : none;
    2. element will not be visible




MORE ABOUT FLEX:

Flex has 6 properties i.e on flex container

1.Align-items
2.Align-content
3.Justify-content
4.Flex-direction
5.Flex-wrap
6.Flex-Flow

1.Flex-direction property :
    It says about in which direction container wants to stack flex items.
  
    .flex-container{
        flex-direction : column;
    }

        flex-direction : column-reverse;
    }

    }
