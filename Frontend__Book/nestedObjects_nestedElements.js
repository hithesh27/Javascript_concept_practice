//What is nested objects and nested element?
/* 
Nested Object means an object inside another object.
Example:
const details={
    name : "Hithesh",
    address : {
        street : "Srinagar colony",
        pincode : 518301
    }

Nested element means an object/array inside another array/object.
So ,here numbers is an array containing other arrays(nested elements).

const numbers = [[1,2],[3,4]]; 
[1,2] is nested array.
