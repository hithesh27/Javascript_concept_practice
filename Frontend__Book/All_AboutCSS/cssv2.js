/**
 * height & width w.r.t parent child divs(block elements - non positioned)
 * 
 * height - if you give a percentage height to child , it first looks up to parent , if parent has non auto height
 * (absolute height in px/vh or valid percentage height w.r.t to its parent)
 * then child height percentage is calculated & honoured else height of child is 0 if
 * no content & if child div has some content inside it , child div's height will be content's height 
 * & percentage is not honoured.
 * By default , the height of a parent is auto i.e it's content's height.
 * 
 * width - Normally all block level elements has 100% width by default & the child blocks(divs) also honour that. percentage & all works as expected here
 * 
 * height & width w.r.t parent child divs(block elements - positioned(mainly absolute & not relative , static))
 * 
 * width - we r talking about default case here , even if it's a block element which should take 100% width , but once you make it absolutely positioned , it's width boils down to only its inner content's width , if no inner content then 0 width.
 * you need to explicitly set width property if you need additional width than content's width. width in % refers w.r.t positioned ancesstor's width.
 * absolute(units/px) width is honoured no matter what in this case.
 * by default content's width is preserved.
 * 
 * height - by default content's height is preserved. If you give % height & if ancestral parent which is relatively positioned doesn't have a height property or invalid height then 
 * the div's height gets corrected to 0 , even content's height is not honoured.
 * if you don't give any height property , contents height is honoured.
 * If not positioned anscestor , then it looks up to viewport & honour % interms of vh.
 * 
 * Note: Above mentioned rules are only when child div is absolutely/fixed positioned. these doesn't apply when child is reatively/default static positioned(non-positioned follows legacy rules 1st section of page)
 * 
 * height: auto -> default height property and it always honours content size and it's not affected by positioning properties
 */

/**
 * whenever you give height property , it is usually for content height , if you give h:100%/100vh & then if you add some borders/margins , the content over-flows the screen 
 * because 100% of height will be given to content & then to accommodate with border thickness , margins etc etc page scrolls
 * To prevent this , add box-sizing: border-box , this means to include border width & margin space also in the height property mentioned.
 * by default , box-sizing: content-box.
 * It's very useful.
 */

/**
 * Absolute Positioning:
 * An absolutely positioned element (position: absolute) calculates its offsets (top, left, etc.) and percentage dimensions (e.g., width: 50%) relative to the nearest ancestor with a non-static position (relative, absolute, fixed, sticky).
 * If no such ancestor exists, it uses the viewport as its containing block.
 * 
 * when position absolute/fixed , the element is removed from normal layout stack & placed in new stack , so the parent div(according to the layout) of the absolutely positioned
 * element may get collapsed to zero height as it doesn;t have any child in its stack. The positioned child honours the margin of its original layouts parent & start in the position 
 * respecting that in new stack. but once you give top,left etc , it gets aligned according to positioned ancestor parent & those margins and all are gone.
 * But margins defined on child are respected even with offsets.
 * 
 * containing blocks:(reference parents)
 * static & relative positions - parent block is containing block.
 * absolute position - containing blocks within nearest non-static ancestor(rel,abs,fixed) or viewport if none. unless special conditions like(parent having transform property/filter/perspective)
 * fixed position - containing block within view port always unless special conditions like(parent having transform/filter/perspective property)
 * sticky -  The nearest scrollable ancestor (usually the viewport). While "stuck" (during scrolling), it behaves like fixed, but its containing block is the scrollable ancestor.
 * Ensure a threshold (e.g., top, left) is defined.Parent must not have overflow: hidden.
 * 
 * static & relative - not removed from original stack so their position in layout is honoured by childs,siblings etc etc
 * 
 * relative - when you apply top,left etc , the element is only moved visually but not in the actual layout & the visual movement is on top of any margin that are already present on the elemnt.
 * it will hover over adjacent elements if needed to satisy top , left properties etc...only margin etc is respected by layout not top,left etc
 * Additive effect(margin(layout) + offset(visual)) -> margin pushes others in layout but offset overlays
 * 
 * absolute & fixed - removed from original stack & positioned w.r.t to their containing blocks only when given offsets, their position in layout is not honoured by children,parent etc , may have to give z-index to avoid over-laps w.r.t to stacks
 * Additive effect(margin(layout) + offset(not sure if its visual here)) only w.r.t to containing block -> margin doesn't push layout as it is removed from original stack
 * 
 * sticky - behaves like relative(position in layout is honoured by others etc unlike fixed which is not honoured) until threshold is breached then it becomes sticky after threshold breach.
 * threshold(top,left etc) is v.imp to sticky else it won't stick. The threshold serves 2 purposes 
 * 1) it actually moves element
 * 2) shift from relative to sticky element
 * If sticky has a parent with overflow:scroll/auto then sticky child looks upto the parent w.r.t to threshold & visual offset else it always looks up to view port
 * Don't think so it's additive , margin changes layout & offset determines threshold typeof stuff + distance as well but think not additive.
 * As soon as threshold offset is met by parent , it sticks. if from beginning itself , threshold is honoured then sticks from beginning.
 * https://elad.medium.com/css-position-sticky-how-it-really-works-54cd01dc2d46
 * 
 * Sticky vs Fixed -> 
 * 1) layout respects elements position in sticky(bcos of same stack) but not in fixed(different stack)
 * 2) offsets always w.r.t viewport in fixed. In sticky offsets & thresholds w.r.t parent with scroll else viewport
 * 3) decision: 
 *    use sticky: places where original layout has to be maintained & need fixed behavour as well -  ex: Table Header(here table header should be respected in layout followed by rows) , Sticky column(same here columns should be first respected in layout)
 *                Also , it's imp to consider the scroll parent & threshold offset.
 *    use fixed: if they should be fixed w.r.t viewport ex: chatbot icon , nav bar
 * 
 * Sticky behaves like fixed when no scrollable parent and top:0 (it sticks to top always) but there is difference in how layout is handled.

// Above are the verified rules , its upto you to remember & implement them , i mean you can practice not possible to implment at once

/**
 * src: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
 * display: flex
 * properties on parent & properties on children
 * 
 * baseline & crossline
 * 
 * parent:
 * flex-direction: row | column | row-reverse | column-reverse
 * flex-wrap: wrap | no-wrap | wrap-reverse(bottom lines  to top lines)
 * flex-flow: short-hand of above both default: row no-wrap
 * 
 * justify-content: defines the alignment along the main axis
 * j-c: space-around(10Child1010child10) , each child has same space around it but observe space between child & edge , child & child
 *      space-evenly(10child10child10) ,  items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.
 * 
 * align-items: flex-start/flex-end/center/stretch(default)/baseline
 * 
 * align-content: Rules for this 1) Applies only to cross axis not to main axis 2) It will apply only when flex-wrap: wrap/wrap-reverse. 
 * it's need ?: when there are multi-line flex items(due to wrap) along cross axis , they form lot of gap between each line naturally (even only with justify-content: wrap & no align-items property),
 * align-items: stretch is the default property on this , that's why they stretch by default
 * even if you give align-items: flex-start/center , it content starts from top/center of y-axxis but it maintains lot of gap between lines & we don't have control over it.
 * That's why align-items doesn;t have property like space-between / space-around bcos by default space is maintained bbetween multi-line items, to control this space you need align-content.
 * 
 * But with align-content: flex-start , there is no gap between flex line items when u give flex-start/end/center/stretch but you'll see gap only if you apply space-between /space-around.
 * but it still has stretch property that makes it look like align-items: stretch i.r gap between flex lines.
 * 
 * justify always refers to main axis & align always refers to cross axis.
 * 
 * 
 * child:
 * flex-grow : proportion(no need of units) .If width is specified to children & 1 child has flex: grow , all child's width will be honoured first before expanding child with flex: grow.
 * In case of shrinkage , flex-grow is compromised before compromising child's width.
 * (not very powerful, it doesn't force other children to give width)
 * If no width is mentioned , then min-width to fit content is honoured before flex-grow. flex-grow is only considered when there is excess space laying around.
 * That extra space is divided proportionatly((total free space/sum of proportions) * current proportion) based on how many childs has this flex-grow property.
 * default value = 0 as flex items won't automatically grow in reality just because some extra space is there
 * this extra -space includes spaces on main axis after honouring elemnt's width/default content width properties including space-between/space-around etc etc.
 * 
 * the flex goes into scroll mode when flex-wrap: no-wrap && min-width/min-content-width is being compromised. Browser never lets min-content/min-width to be compromised , instead it goes into scroll mode.
 * 
 * flex-shrink: proportion , If there is a situation where all children of flex are to be shrinked , you can control which child should shrink more or which childs will not shrink at all/less.
 * shrinking will stop at min content width/height , after this point other children gets started shrinking. then scroll
 * if proportion is 0 , that means this element should never shrink no matter what , it will shrink others to min-width & scroll but never shrink the element(quite powerful)
 * propertion is 1 , default value , all childs should shrink equally
 * if proprtion of a child is higher than other child , then it will shrink more compared to other child
 * flex-shrink doesn't take effect if flex-wrap: wrap is defined , the flex-elements get wrapped as soon as given width property is compromised , let alone compromising min-width or content body width
 * 
 * 
 * flex-basis: it is the default size that a flex item should have in the flex layout. It is given more priority/honour w.r.t to width propertie of other children but not w.r.t min-width/max-width/content-width.
 * It even uses/over-powers other childs width to honours it's own basis width.(bit powerful forces others to give up width)
 * when by default if you want to assign a fixed width to flex items , you can use this.
 * default is flex-basis: auto (normal width mentioned), flex-basis: 0 (shrink the width to min content body width).
 * if needed to shrink , then shrink over-powers basis
 * 
 * Also, texts like p tag, h tags wont increase in size/font-size just becuase we gave flex-grow/basis on them , they just expand and occupy more space as just white space
 * 
 * // It is a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis & it's used decetly w.r.t responsivness across devices
 * ex: flex: 1 10% or 1 10px or 1
 * 
 * align-self: it has align-items options but it is specific to individual child/item alignment in flex;
 * doesn;t seem to work when flex-wrap:wrap is applied.
 * Imp: align is always w.r.t cross axis. In general scenario y-axis
 * defining height property to parent is v.imp in making use of this y-axis
 * ex: height: 100vh makes use of full vp , no height makes it height:auto which is just content's height
 * 
 * row-gap,column-gap
 * gap: row col: It is preserved at any cost , width is compromised to preserve gap.
 * min-width & default content width is not compromised but gap is also not compromised , so the flex container goes into scroll mode.
 * gap is like minimum gap required between rows/columns, it will come into effect only when that min-gap is being compromised. if space-around/between/evenly is manitaining that gap then great , gap doesnt come live else it automatically enforces.
 * 
 * flex-direction: columns - key points:
 * 1) All rules gets reversed w.r.t to flex-direction: row.
 *    align-items will be w.r.t row alignment
 *    justify-content will be w.r.t column alignment
 *    align-content will be w.r.t column alignment 
 * 
 * 2) parent should have a fixed/valid height property like vh,px or valid % else below properties won't work becuase of height: auto
 *    justify-content -> bcos height:auto , vertical space available is just content height , so no visible effect of applying propeties like center, space-around etc etc. need to have fixed extra space to have visible effect.
 *    flex-wrap -> it never wraps becuase of height: auto , we have infinite height. again need to limit height & then it wraps to next column after limit breach
 *    flex-basis -> works as it defines initial height & since we hv initial height , it is always respected.
 *    flex-grow -> grow works with extra space on flex layout & since height: auto gives only content space , no extra space
 *    flex-shrink -> shrink comes into picture if you're shortage of space but in this case we always have just enough space so wont work
 *
 * Flex tries its best to prevent hroizantal scrolling but it scroll when width available is less than minimum content of children. incase of parent width :100%(most divs) , it adds scroll automatically
 * But incase of fixed width(< vw) parent , children go beyond the parent boundary & you need to manually add a scroll bar or over-flow etc etc or wrap.
 * Even having flex-basis with good width don't enforce overflow/scroll , 
 * Always remember m if you dont defined height property , height: auto & it takes content height only , width on div/block elements ia always 100%(not incase of absolutely positioned) by default unless explicitly mentioned.
 *

/**
 * scrolling: 
 * 1) Most of the inline/inline-block items don't overflow/scroll/break parent width horizantally by default, unless explicitly specified otherwise by saying white-space: nowrap;
 * 2) texts also wrap when they think they are exceeding parent's width , again they break out even when minimum width(largest word) is also not possible. 
 * most likely they wont break out for regular sentances but for sentances with larger words/no white-spaces , you can use overflow-wrap: break-word , that helps fit within width.
 * 3) These properties apply to any block or inline element that has text as it's content. 
 *    Also if you apply this to a parent & if its children are inline/inline-block , then you can even control the alignment of children similar to flex-wrap even if you don't give flex to parent. 
 * 
 *    *all inline/inline-block elements gets wrapped by default within parent's width, so they wont overflow, you can use nowrap to prevent that.
 * 
 * 4) white-space: nowrap when applied to parent does not force block-level children to stay in a single line like incase of inline-block/inline children.
 *    But it still applies to texts of parent & text of children as well.
 *
 * 5) scroll along y-axis/x-axis is natural on vp(bcos on root overflow: scroll by default) , happens when child content height/width exceeds parent. scroll comes automatically & 
 *    also only flex tries to avoid scrolling by squeezing heights/widths(because flex-shrink: 1 by default on all elements)of children but in normal cases.
 *    child content height/width is  breaks out of parent height/width & scroll is formed naturally on vp. But if you want to create a scroll on parent did with vp , i think you need to mention accordingly

/**
 * margin: auto
 * In standard flow , margin: auto works only with block level elements with fixed width(else block default width is 100% & no space for margins etc) , it can center a block level element horizantally only but not vertically.
 * In flex flow , margin: auto can center a flex item vertically(provided flex container has valid height) & horizantally also even without height/width property on flex item
 * It can over-power Alignment Properties(justify-content etc etc) , ex: applying margin-left: auto will push element as right as possible while maintaining the order , Pushes the flex item as far to the left as possible along the main axis (horizontal by default).Absorbs all available space between the item and its siblings, distributing it to the right.
 * similarly it wors for margin-right , top etc etc
 * How to Achieve Left Alignment in Flexbox
 * Use margin-right: auto to push an item to the left edge (main axis).
 * Use justify-content: flex-start on the container to align all items to the left (main axis).
