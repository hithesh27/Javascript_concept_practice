/* 
What does it mean by an element is collapsed it means it will take up default values i.e 
height and width as auto
Default font-size for html element is 16px.
font-size will always be inherited from its parent font-size.If it not mentioned.


Understanding containing block:-
child Height is 2 times of the height of containing block.
Example : 
containing block means parent.

If height or width is NOT explicitly specified, it defaults to auto.
width: auto Explained
For block elements: Expands to 100% of the parentâ€™s width (unless constrained).
For inline elements: Shrinks to fit its content (ignores width).

height: auto Explained
The height expands only as much as needed to fit the content.
If there's no content, the height collapses to 0px.

Two kinds of units:
--> Relative Units     --> Absolute Units


--> Absolute Units:
Absolute Units are fixed and donot change based on screen size or context.
They are great for precise measurements and lack flexibility for responsive designs.
examples : px(pixels) , centimeters(cm) , inches(in) .
--> Relative Units:
Relative Units are dynamic depends on reference.
ex:parent element,root element,view port size.
They are ideal for responsive designs because they adjust based on context.
1.em 
    Their are many cases on em.
    parent and child??
    case:i 
    .parent{
        font-size :15px;
    }
    .child{
        font-size   :20px;
        width       :3em; //for width it looks for its font-size .If its font-size it looks for its parent.
        //width : 60px;
    }
    case:ii 
    .parent{
        font-size :20px;
    }
    .child{
        font-size   :3em; //it looks for its ancestor so font-size : 60px;
        width       :2em; //for width it looks for its font-size .So here it is mentioned as width: 120px;
    }
    case:iii
    .parent{
        font-size :20px;
    }
    .child{
       //in this case font-size is not mentioned so it takes its parents font-size 20px
        width       :2em; //for width it looks for its font-size .So here it is mentioned as width: 40px;
        (so width always tries to look at parents font-size.)
    }
2.rem
    1rem refers to size based on root element fontsize i.e html element.
    parent fontsize:2px,html fontsize:5px
Example: 2em  : 4px
         2rem : 10px
3.%
It refers to dependency based on size of parent.
    for width %  is always relative to parents width.Incase of width even if it is auto but still child takes half of it.
    and as parent is set to auto it takes from its parent.
    for height%  only works if parent has an explicit height(Otherwise it gets collapsed).
    When using percentage (%) units, overflow is more likely to happen vertically because
    height can collapse, but width does not.
    for padding% means width of the containing block.
    for margin%  means width of the containing block.
    margin: 10% applies 10% of the parent's width on each side.
    let suppose parent is 100px width then 
    then for child {
        margin : 10%;
    }
    for font-size% means font-size of the parent.
    for line-height% means font-size of that element itself.
    It depends on parent element width or height .
    for padding/margin :It depends on parent element width. 
4.vh or vw
    ViewPort is based on size of browser window
    ViewPort Height vh
    ViewPort width  vw
    ViewPort is the window through which users view a webpage.
    example :
    1vw : 1% of viewport width
    50vw: 50% of viewport width
    1vh : 1% of viewport height
    50vh: 50% of viewport height
    10vh means 10% of viewport height
    100vh means 100% of viewport height
    30vw means 30% of viewport width
5.vmin or vmax
   vmin or vmax is the max or min of the viewport height or width.
   vmin means it takes minimum of viewport of height or width.
   xvmin means xpercentage of min(height,width).
   xvmax means xpercentage of max(height,width).
   .age{
        height:10vmin;
   }
