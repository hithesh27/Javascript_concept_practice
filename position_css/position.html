                            POSITION PROPERTY

Position property says types of positioning method used for an element.
 5 different position values

1.static
2.relative
3.fixed
4.absolute
5.sticky

top,left,right,bottom will start working only after mentioning postion value.
they also work differently based on different position value.

Static :
html elements are positioned static by default . 
static positioned elements are not affected by right , left , top , bottom .
These elements are positioned in normal way of the web page flow .

Relative :
*****positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting top,left,right,bottom properties of a relatively positioned element will cause it to be 
positioned away from normal position.
*****Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
When I mention Top:100px;
then the updated position will have distance from existing position as 100px.

Fixed :
*****positioned relative to viewport.
which means it stays at same place even if page is scrolled.
top,left,right,bottom are used to position the element.
*****A fixed element doesnot leave a gap in the page where it would have been normally located.
*****This fixed will also be mixed with other elements

Absolute :
element with positioned absolute is positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor.
instead of postioned relative to viewport.
If no positioned ancestor then it moves along with the scrolling and it then considers document as 
reference.

nearest positioned ancestor :

1.Fixed 
2.Absolute
3.Relative 


Sticky :
sticky postioned element will only work if only one of them is mentioned left , right , top , bottom.
element is positioned based on users scroll position.

***** alone left or right doesnot work( for horizontal position ). 
along with that their is a need of using top or bottom.
it will be present in
